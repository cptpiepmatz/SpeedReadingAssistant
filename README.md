## About
SpeedReadingAssistant is a tool to read texts in ridiculous speeds.
This is achieved by centering the word to read in the middle of the screen.
Therefore it is not needed to move your eyes to the sides or up and down.

Mostly this tool was written for a friend but maybe other people enjoy it too.

1. Insert your text in the input text field.
2. Click convert
3. Set up your desired speed in the input field at the bottom
4. Absorb all the texts
